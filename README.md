# UltraSandbox

# Turning Ultrakill into a garrys mod like game


Welcome to my repo! This is a pretty basic mod but the premise is for players to be able to make "model packs" that can be loaded within the game to make a sort of "garrys mod addon" feel 



# Putting your assetbundle

[Making a assetbundle](https://github.com/Minepool9/UltraSandbox/wiki/)

All of the assetbundles go into Bepinex/Plugins/HotLoadedBundles, Remember the mod only loads .prefabs and not any fbx files make sure the prefab is size you want + has the box colliders, AND MAKE SURE THE BUNDLE well has a .bundle extension to it (should be added via the script)

**note: the ui.bundle goes with the dll not in HotloadedBundles! Remember every actual bundle goes to that folder however the ui.bundle gets compiled with the dll itself**

# WHAT THE MOD (likely) SUPPORTS 

if it can be a prefab it can be loaded this includes entire maps (untested, maybe works without triggers idk how to give a trigger component or whatever)

~~Ragdolls via unity's system of ragdoll implmentation (untested but most likely)~~

# TO DO FOR REPO

~~1.wiki~~

2.building instructions



# TO DO FOR THE MOD

~~loading more than 1 assetbundle~~

~~rotating any object in sandbox~~

making ragdolls be able to be moved and interactable 

~~when loading more than 1 assetbundle you can change what assetbundle you are loading from instead of 1 huge list of objects~~ 

searching for objects via a gui

basic buttons and basically redstone from minecraft

and finally a "save" function



# TO DO FOR MYSELF AND FOR CONSTTRIBUTORS TO DO 

fucking understanding how shaders work so you dont have to manually change the shader of a material everytime you create an assetbundle, PLEASE IF YOU ARE MORE EXPERIENCED WITH HOW SHADERS WORK FUCKING MAKE A PULL REQUEST AND WRITE CODE FOR IT PLEASE I BEG YOU I JUST WANNA USE PSX/VERTEXLIT/VERTEXLIT

get the menu to fucking work
