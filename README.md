# UltraSandbox

# Turning Ultrakill into a garrys mod game


Welcome to my repo! This is a pretty basic mod but the premise is for players to be able to make "model packs" that can be loaded within the game to make a sort of "garrys mod addon" feel 

# Putting your assetbundle (NOTE: Current functionality of the mod only allows 1 asset bundle named "testassets" to be loaded however in the future this will be changed to load every bundle file in HotLoadedBundles)

All of the assetbundles go into Bepinex/Plugins/HotLoadedBundles

#TO DO FOR THE MOD

loading more than 1 assetbundle
rotating any object in sandbox 
making ragdolls be able to be moved and interactable 
when loading more than 1 assetbundle you can change what assetbundle you are loading from instead of 1 huge list of objects 
searching for objects 
basic buttons and basically redstone 

and finally a "save" function
