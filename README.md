# UltraSandbox

# Turning Ultrakill into a garrys mod like game


Welcome to my repo! This is a pretty basic mod but the premise is for players to be able to make "model packs" that can be loaded within the game to make a sort of "garrys mod addon" feel 



# Putting your assetbundle (NOTE: Current functionality of the mod only allows 1 asset bundle named "testassets" to be loaded however in the future this will be changed to load every bundle file in HotLoadedBundles)

All of the assetbundles go into Bepinex/Plugins/HotLoadedBundles 



# BUILDING THE MOD (note: this is different than building an actual assetbundle)

[Just look at the readme here](https://github.com/Minepool9/UltraSandbox/blob/main/UltraSandbox/README.md)

# TO DO FOR THE MOD

loading more than 1 assetbundle

rotating any object in sandbox

making ragdolls be able to be moved and interactable 

when loading more than 1 assetbundle you can change what assetbundle you are loading from instead of 1 huge list of objects 

searching for objects via a gui

basic buttons and basically redstone from minecraft

and finally a "save" function



# TO DO FOR MYSELF

fucking understanding how shaders work so you dont have to manually change the shader of a material everytime you create an assetbundle, PLEASE IF YOU ARE MORE EXPERIENCED WITH HOW SHADERS WORK FUCKING MAKE A PULL REQUEST AND WRITE CODE FOR IT PLEASE I BEG YOU
